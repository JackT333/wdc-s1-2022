<h1>A page with some divs and spans</h1>

<p>This page looks much cleaner now that 
    I've put my content in div with a white
    background.</p>

<p>Because this div is special, it has it's own
   id "content".<br/>
    This allows us to differentiate it from other divs and give 
    it a white background.</p>

<hr>

<p>This is a normal pargraph, except 
    <span class = "blue">this span of text is blue</span>
    <span class = "fancy">and this span has a font-family of cursive,</span><br/>
    because they belongs to two classes called "blue" and "fancy" respectively.
</p>

<p>On the other hand, <span class = "blue"><span class = "fancy"> 
this span of text is both blue and fancy!</span></span>
</p>
</div>

<div>This text is inside a normal div, but the background has not been set.</div>
